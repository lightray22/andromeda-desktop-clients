# Overview

This repo contains the native applications and common libraries for Andromeda's web-based file storage API.  All require that the server have the core, accounts, and files apps active.  

### Targets

There are several binaries and libraries in the full suite.
- `src/lib/andromeda` the core library that implements communication with the server
- `src/bin/andromeda-cli` allows manual command line communication with the server
- `src/bin/andromeda-fuse` and `src/lib/andromeda-fuse` for mounting as local storage
- FUTURE `src/bin/andromeda-sync` and `src/lib/andromeda-sync` for running directory sync
- `src/bin/andromeda-gui` a Qt-based GUI client for local mounting and directory sync


# Building

Run `tools/buildrel` for a release build.  To install, run `tools/buildrel inst`.  Run `tools/builddev` for a development build including unit tests and static analysis.  Use `tools/builddev rel` to build a release build with debugger info.

The manual cmake steps:

1. Make build folder `mkdir build; cd build`
2. Initialize cmake `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug|Release" ..`
3. Run compile `cmake --build .`

### Build System

- C++17 compiler
- cmake (>= 3.16)
- Python3 (>= 3.8?)
- Bash (if running tools/)

### Build Options
  
- By default, all targets will be built. To build one target individually, configure cmake targeted at the directory you desire to build, then make normally.  This also will only require dependencies for that target.  E.g. `cmake ../src/bin/andromeda-fuse; cmake --build .`.  To only skip the Qt GUI, use `-DWITHOUT_GUI=1`.  
- By default, position-independent executables (PIE) are built.  This can be disabled with `-DWITHOUT_PIE=1`.  
- The build will fail if any compiler warnings are encountered.  This can be disabled with `-DALLOW_WARNINGS=1`.

### Prerequisite Libraries

- libandromeda
  - OpenSSL (libssl, libcrypto) (1.1.1 or 3.0.x)
  - sqlite3 (3.x >= 3.31)
  - libsodium (1.0.x >= 1.0.18)
- libandromeda-fuse
  - libfuse (3.x >= 3.9? or 2.x >= 2.9?) https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse
    - for macOS, use OSXFUSE https://osxfuse.github.io/
    - For Windows, install WinFSP (with Developer) https://winfsp.dev/rel/
- andromeda-gui
  - Qt (Windows/macOS: >= 6.5, Linux: >= 5.12)

These libraries are dynamically linked and must be available at runtime.
On Windows this means the folders containing the DLLs for each library must be in your $PATH.
Some other dependencies will be fetched by cmake and built in-tree.

### Supported Platforms

The following platforms (GCC 9.4+, Clang 10+) are targeted for support and should work:

- Windows 10 x64 ([cmake](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/), [MSVC++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 17/2022, [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), [OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html), [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/download), [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html), [Sodium](https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/))
  - You may need to add `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` to your system environment
  - You may need to add `SQLITE3_ROOT_DIR` to your system environment
    - To build sqlite3.lib, follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/zeljic/d8b542788b225b1bcb5fce169ee28c55)
  - You may need to add `sodium_DIR` to your system environment
  - `WINFSP_ROOT_DIR` can also be set but defaults to `C:/Program Files (x86)/WinFsp`

- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install make cmake g++ python3 libssl-dev libcrypt-dev`
  - Ubuntu 20.04 amd64 `apt install fuse libfuse-dev qtbase5-dev libsqlite3-dev libsodium-dev`
  - Ubuntu 23.10 amd64 `apt install fuse3 libfuse3-dev qt6-base-dev libsqlite3-dev libsodium-dev`
  - Debian 11 armhf `apt install fuse3 libfuse3-dev qt6-base-dev libsqlite3-dev libsodium-dev`
- Arch Linux amd64: `pacman -S make cmake gcc python openssl fuse3 qt6-base sqlite libsodium`
- Void Linux amd64: `xbps-install gcc python3 cmake make openssl-devel fuse3-devel qt6-base-devel sqlite-devel libsodium-devel`
- macOS amd64: `brew install make cmake openssl macfuse qt sqlite libsodium`

The following platforms are supported minus the Qt GUI (it may work, just not tested):

- Alpine Linux amd64: `apk add make cmake g++ python3 openssl-dev fuse3-dev sqlite-dev libsodium-dev`
- FreeBSD 13.2/14.0 amd64: `pkg install cmake python fusefs-libs3 sqlite3 libsodium`
- OpenBSD 6.7 amd64: `pkg_add cmake libsodium`

Note for FreeBSD to allow FUSE mounting by regular users, you will need to add your user to the operator group with `pw group mod operator -m $(whoami)`, and enable user mounting with `sysctl vfs.usermount=1`.  FreeBSD FUSE currently has a few issues that may result in ERR#78 (Not implemented) errors on file accessat() and close().  OpenBSD only allows FUSE mount/unmount by the super user.

FUTURE - libandromeda on NetBSD 9.3 does not compile with the default GCC 7 or with librefuse - you must install the GCC 9 and fuse packages.  andromeda-fuse does not currently work at runtime: `fuse: writing device: Message too long`.
- NetBSD 9.3 amd64: `pkgin install gcc9 gcc9-libs cmake python311 fuse sqlite3 libsodium`

# CLI Client

The CLI client emulates using the command-line Andromeda server API, but over a remote HTTP connection and in JSON mode.  Requires libandromeda.

Any features that rely on the higher privileges of the real CLI interface are not available. Examples:
* Changing the database configuration file
* PHP printr format (JSON only)
* Changing debug/metrics output
* Doing a request dry-run

The general usage is the same as the real CLI interface, but with different global options, and with -- before the server command.  Parameter syntax, attaching/uploading files and using environment variables is the same ([syntax reference](https://github.com/irondrive/andromeda-server#general-usage)).

Note that non-file and non-environment action params will be sent as URL variables.  Use stdin (opt@ or opt!) or environment variables for private data, as they will be sent in the POST body instead.  

Run `./andromeda-cli --help` to see the available options.  

Example that shows the available API calls: `./andromeda-cli -a (url) -- core usage`


# FUSE Client

The FUSE client allows mounting Andromeda storage as local storage using FUSE.  Requires libandromeda and libandromeda-fuse.

Run `./andromeda-fuse --help` to see the available options.
Authentication details (password, twofactor) will be prompted for interactively as required.

The ID of a folder to mount can also be specified in the `-a` URL.
If no folder/filesystem ID is provided, the "SuperRoot" will be mounted
containing all filesystems and other special folders.

The FUSE client can either connect to a remote server via HTTP by specifying a URL with `-a`,
or it can run the server as a local program by specifying the path with `-p`.  Using `-p` as a 
flag rather than an option will attempt to use $PATH to find the server.

When running via CLI by default it will just use the `auth_sudouser` option with the server
rather than creating and using a session.  This will make storages with encrypted credentials
inaccessible.  You can force the use of a session with `--force-session`.

There is also a `mount.andromeda` wrapper for mounting via posix `mount` or `fstab`.
The mount wrapper uses the `dev path [-o opt1,opt2]` format and cannot prompt interactively.
Options beginning with "-" are passed to andromeda, otherwise they are passed to FUSE via "-o".  

## Debug

The `--cachemode enum` option is also useful for debugging caching.

- none - turns off caching and sends every read/write to the server (slow!)
- memory - never reads/writes the server, only memory (data loss!)
- normal - the normal mode of cache operation


# Qt GUI Client

This is in VERY early demo-stage development!

The Qt GUI client implements a GUI for mounting Andromeda storage using FUSE.   Requires libandromeda and libandromeda-fuse.


# Common Usage

Given HTTP server URLs can optionally include the protocol, the port number, and URL variables.  For example both of the following are valid: `myhostname` and `https://myhostname.tld:4430/test.php?urlvar`.  The default protocol is HTTP, so specifying `https://` ensures TLS is always used even if the server is not setup to redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

## Config Files

Any option or flag accepted on the command line can also be listed in a config file.
Common config in `libandromeda.conf` is loaded first (but ignored for andromeda-gui), then per-binary config (e.g. `andromeda-fuse.conf`).
The config files can be located in `/etc/andromeda`, `/usr/local/etc/andromeda`, `~/.config/andromeda`, or the current directory.
A custom path to a config file can also be specified with the `-c` or `--config-file` option, and is loaded last.

Config Example:
```
# Example config file
apiurl=myserv.tld
read-only
```

#### Runtime Debug

Using the `-d int` or `--debug int` option turns on debug.  Errors are always printed.

0. Runs the app in the foreground (if applicable)
1. Reports all calls to the backend
2. Shows many function calls and extra info (a lot!)
3. With each print shows the time, thread ID, and object ID  

Use `--debug-filter` to show debug only from the component names given, e.g. `--debug-filter FuseOperations,FuseAdapter`.

Use of any documentation (wiki, readme, etc.) is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0) license.

## Doxygen

Use the `tools/mkdocs` script from the repo root to generate documentation using Doxygen.  It will output separately for each bin/lib subdirectory.  This requires `doxygen` and `graphviz`.  Use `tools/mkdocs latex` to generate LaTEX PDFs - requires `doxygen-latex`.  

## Testing

Unit testing is done with catch2 and trompeloeil, which are built in-tree.  Configure cmake with `-DTESTS_CATCH2=1` to build and run tests.

Static analysis is done with clang-tidy and cppcheck.  These must be installed on the system.  Configure cmake with `-DTESTS_CLANGTIDY=1` to run clang-tidy.  Configure cmake with `-DTESTS_CPPCHECK=1` to run cppcheck.  Use `-DALLOW_WARNINGS=1` to allow the build to pass with warnings.  cppcheck is somewhat buggy and warnings can be ignored after careful analysis.

Unit tests and static analysis are both enabled in the `tools/builddev` script.

## Sanitizers

`-DSANITIZE` allows building with sanitizers with GCC and Clang (debug builds only).  The default is `address,leak,undefined` (AddressSanitizer, LeakSanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer).  Other (mutually-exclusive) options include `memory` (MemorySanitizer) (Clang only), and `thread` (ThreadSanitizer).  See [GCC Instrumentation Options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html) and [Google Sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers).  

These must be disabled (use `none`) to use Valgrind tools.  LeakSanitizer does not work on AppleClang (macOS).  No sanitizers work on musl libc (Alpine Linux).
